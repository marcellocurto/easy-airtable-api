# Easy Airtable API

At the moment this is just a shell and not ready to be used. Will add more soon.

I don't like using the official Airtable SDK and find myself repeatedly rebuilding the same functionality in different projects. So, it's time to consolidate everything into one package.

## Install

```
npm install easy-airtable-api
```
