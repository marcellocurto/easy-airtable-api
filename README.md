# Easy Airtable API

At the moment this is just a shell and not ready to be used. Will add more soon.

I don't like using the official Airtable SDK and find myself repeatedly rebuilding the same functionality in different projects. So, it's time to consolidate everything into one package.

## Install

```
npm install easy-airtable-api
```

## Changelog

### 0.0.2

- basic request functions to get or update records
- added type defintions for requests and fields
- basic tests to check core functionality of library

### 0.0.1

- basic project setup - no real functionality.
